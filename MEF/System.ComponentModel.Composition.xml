            Generates the code that loads the supplied value on the stack
            This is not as simple as it seems, as different instructions need to be generated depending
            on its type.
            We support:
            1. All primitive types
            2. Strings
            3. Enums
            4. typeofs
            5. nulls
            6. Dictionaries of (string, object) recursively containing all of the above
            7. Enumerables
            8. Delegates on static functions or any of the above
            Everything else cannot be represented as literals

            Lazily init an item and return stats as to whether or not you were the winner who
            succeeded in initing that item. Takes a delegate that creates the object to be
            initialized with, that delegate needs to be idempotent.
            
            A common example might be initing some static member f of type Foo:
            
                class Bar
                {
                    static Foo f;

            The implementers should not treat the cardinality-related mismatches as errors, and are not
            expected to throw exceptions in those cases.
            For instance, if the import requests exactly one export and the provider has no matching exports or more than one,
            it should return an empty <see cref="T:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1"/> of <see cref="T:System.ComponentModel.Composition.Export"/>.
